Create new instance could be:

    $ grunt create:<type>:<route/name>

`types` can be:

* app - generates app structure
* route - puts new route in routes folder
* service - puts new service in common/services folder
* directive - puts new directive in common/directives folder
* partial - puts new partial in common/partials folder
* filter - puts new filter in common/filters folder
* config - puts new config in common/configs folder

For deleting the instance **Grunt** will work with same way

    $ grunt delete:<type>:<route/name>
